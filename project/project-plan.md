# Project Plan
The primary objective of the project is to investigate the correlation between temperature and road accidents, as there has been a recent increase in accidents, and the goal is to determine how temperature influences accident rates..
## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Examining the evolving trends and connection between road accidents and the average temperature in Germany.
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. The changes of the temparature
2. How the rate of road accident increasing day by day?
3. Is there any realtion between road accident and the temparature?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
I will try to find the dataset and make some preprocessing such as removing null values, i have the data of average temparature daily and I have the monthly data of accident, so I have to make it average and see the changes of temparature and the changes of road accident and see the relations.
