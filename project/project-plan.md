The primary objective of the project is to investigate the correlation between temperature and road accidents, as there has been a recent increase in accidents, and the goal is to determine how temperature influences accident rates..
## Title

Examining the evolving trends and connection between road accidents and the average temperature in Germany.
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. The changes of the temparature
2. How the rate of road accident increasing day by day?
3. Is there any realtion between road accident and the temparature?
